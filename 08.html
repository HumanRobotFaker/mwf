        <P> <span class ="violetstart">_</span><span class ="violet">Jack Bone</span><span class ="violetend">_</span>  climbed out to the surface of the asteroid, awaiting for the pickup of his pirate ship. Perhaps this was a set-up, he wondered. Maybe the solar systematic authorities (SSA) were set to arrive an incarcerate him for his crimes against Timothy Haught. Jack licked his lips in memory of the horrific act. A pulse of senuous pleasure hummed through his bodies, as he remembered the feeling of his orbital floor as he scraped out his eyes. </P>

        <P> Then he saw the vessel. It had an oversized fuel tank, loaded with extra U-235 fuel, as this vessel couldn't depend upon gravity assists while it traveled incognito. An electromagnetic cloud lifted Jack up and brought him inside the ship.</P>

        <P> When Jack nestled into his hibernation pod, laying his head on the cushioned pillow, a wave of anxiety overcame his being. Was this the last thought he'd ever have? When he went to sleep in the hibernation pod -- while he was asleep in the hibernation pod -- would something go terribly wrong? Would this be the last memory he ever had? </P>
        
        <P> Jack whisked away the thought, closed his eyes, and let the medication put him to sleep.

        </P>
