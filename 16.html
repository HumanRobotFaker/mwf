    <p>Allen continued walking. He knew he should view life as a miracle, but he found it so difficult to perceive existence through that lens at that very moment. Instead, he viewed it as a oozing mold atop a rock. He was the ooze. He oozed, slipped, slid, and locomotived. He devoured the life force of other ooze. How strange it was to be alive? But strangeness didn't feel liked blessedness. But then again, he s'posed it shouldn't equate to cursedness either.</p>

    <p> Allen looked up to the sky, at the stars he could see with his eyes and his optical-enhanced iContacts. Colors, wavelengths, differently shaped atoms absorbing electric-magnetic disturbances. </p>
