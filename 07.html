<P><span class= "yellowstart">_</span><span class ="yellow">Allen Greggs</span><span class ="yellowend">_</span> looked down on the swarming masses from his luxury box. The motley crew of penguin cyborgs and CRISPR-enhanced lumpenproletariat were enthralled with the action being provided to them by <span class= "greenstart">_</span><span class ="green">Mo[o]nday Night Mania</span><span class ="greenend">_</span>, the soap operatic, hyperbolic nonsense, where muscled men and genetic freaks are heralded as heroes and villains. He watched them waste their weekly wages on canned krill juice and tiny hats, reveling in their hedonistic experiences, seeking a pathway to «riding the vibe» as the newspapers wrote. </P>

<p> They seem happy down there. But they disgusted Allen Greggs.</p>

<p> Then again, a wave of self-loathing hit. What was he? A manager? Of merchants, monies, and penguin-men?  Making sure the mines are at maximum efficiency and the workers aren't about to self-collectivize and seize the means of production? The absurdity of it all was started to permeate Allen's being. His cells. His DNA. What was he doing here on this mazda-saken moon? </p>

Psycho Bunny and Astronaut Al, those wretched, degenerate hoodlums, prepare to lose their championship to the impeachable duo of HARD WORK and SUCCESS!

        <p class="action">Inside the ring, the human in the pink rabbit suit passed a bottle of yeefass to Astronaut Al, who takes a swig. Astronaut Al calls for a microphone and one is thrown to him.</p>

        <p class="action">«DULL!» the crowd shouts. The crowd then proceeds to chant "DOUBLE-U! DOUBLE-U!", which is an allusion to the tag team champions' previous name of <I>'Ucked Up'</I>.</p>

        <p> Up in his luxury box, Allen Greggs felt an intense urge to vomit. He ran to the bathroom and leaned over the toilet just in time to send the putrid gastric expulsion into the porcelain bowl. </p>

        <P> Greggs flushed it down, washed his hands and face, and returned to the luxury box. He thought about his wife right now, downtown at the injection-lounge, laying there in a drugged lucid dream stupor, and a great despair overcame his being. About the stupidity of it all. </P>

        <P> He wondered how reinforced the glass of the luxury box windows were.</P>
