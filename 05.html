Folks, you won't believe what just happened. <BR><BR> Backstage, during our advertisement break, Jack Bone viciously attacked Tim Haught. And I know we speak hyperbolically on this program, but... this attack TRULY was vicious.

Justice Enforcement personnel are in pursuit of the fugitive, former BTW Champion, Jack Bone. We will keep you updated as soon as we receive information. <BR><BR> But, I believe I can certainly declare that we will never again see Jack Bone perform in a professional wrestling match.

Everyone's hearts and concerns are for Tim Haught, who is undergoing emergency surgery, and for all those who love Tim Haught. May his condition be amelorioated and may his recovery be swift.
