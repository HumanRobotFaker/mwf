    <p> Tim Haught's walk through the mass audience becomes quite belabored, as the penguin workers do not allow a clear path to the ring. Instead, they pat Tim Haught on the back, grope him, spill their drinks happily on him.

    <p> The head referee in <span class ="greystart">_</span><span class ="grey">Uriah Bleu</span><span class ="greyend">_</span> slides into the ring. He goes to check Jack Bone's gloves for foreign objects, but Jack Bone brushes him off, and climbs out of the ring.
